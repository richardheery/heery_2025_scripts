# Create a list with different promoter definitions for protein-coding transcripts 

# Promoter definitions come from the following 5 papers:
# A: Chen = -200-0 bp. From Tissue-independent and tissue-specific patterns of DNA methylation alteration in cancer; Epigenetics Chromatin. 2016
# B: Saghafinia -300-300 bp. From Pan-Cancer Landscape of Aberrant DNA Methylation across Human Tumors; Cell Reports. 2018
# C: Li = -2000-200 bp. From A genomic and epigenomic atlas of prostate cancer in Asian populations; Nature 2020
# D: Noushmehr -1500-1500 bp. From Identification of a CpG Island Methylator Phenotype that Defines a Distinct Subgroup of Glioma; Cancer Cell. 2010
# E: Cao = -4500-500 bp. From Multi-faceted epigenetic dysregulation of gene expression promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; Nature Communications. 2020
